# Moving-Cat-Game
a game where the cat moves around the screen

Using python, this is a game where a cat moves around a screen. The object is to click on the cat as many times as possible. 
When you successfully click on the cat, the speed of the game increases. 
If you miss nine times, the game is over.

My first attempt at programming a game. Learning about the game loop and such.
